ＦＡＮＣＹ ＷＯＲＬＤ
====================
An experimental GZDoom mod that adds audiovisual effects to pre-existing maps without need for mapper intervention.

This is the development repo - the versions you find here will be unstable and have even worse coding than the release versions. You should only be here if you're an awesome modder who knows what they're doing, or you're actively looking for bugs. Either way, there's probably something wrong with you.
